      "Purrlock Paws grew up as the only child of her parents, living in a secluded cabin deep in the forests of northwestern Middle Earth. As a child, she knew little about her family's past. Her world revolved around studying nature and observing the patterns of life surrounding her. She had no contact with anyone outside her family and, for a long time, never questioned it. Her parents treated her kindly—her mother was nurturing and warm, while her father was strict but loving. Though Purrlock was highly intelligent and often a joy to be around, there were moments when a darker side of her emerged. Her father seemed oblivious to these tendencies, but her mother watched with growing concern and fear. The truth about their family’s history was a secret they never shared with her. Her father had once been a brilliant general of their tribe, a man who fought countless battles and never knew defeat. His victories made him invaluable to the king, but his methods were controversial. Ruthless and unyielding, he would do anything to secure victory. While his success brought wealth and power to the tribe, his endless thirst for war grew troubling. Even after defeating all their enemies, he wanted more battles, more conquests, and more glory. This relentless ambition terrified the king and his advisors, who preferred to maintain their newfound prosperity rather than risk it through endless battles. Rumors of the general’s unchecked aggression began to spread, especially among the younger generations, who wanted peace with neighboring kingdoms. Fearing rebellion, the king made a drastic decision: He exiled his old friend to a distant corner of the world, to Middle Earth. The general was furious but had no choice but to comply. In exile, he plotted his return, dreaming of reclaiming his position and planning his revenge. Everything changed with the birth of his daughter. His rage cooled, and as the years passed, his plans for vengeance faded into dreams. When Purrlock turned eleven, her mother fell gravely ill and soon passed away. To most, the death of a parent would bring overwhelming grief, but Purrlock's reaction was unexpectedly cold. A year later, her father also succumbed to illness, leaving Purrlock entirely alone. While going through her father's belongings, she discovered hidden writings—letters from the king of their tribe. These letters revealed the truth about her father's exile and their family's history. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Purrlock decided to leave the forest and search for her tribe and the world beyond her secluded home. She travelled east and eventually reached her first major city. The sights and sounds of the bustling streets amazed her, and she encountered other members of her tribe who had ventured out. They told her the old king had died of age, and the new king's leadership was failing their people. Initially, Purrlock intended to stay in the city only briefly, but the allure of its mysteries and the people she met kept her there. She came under the mentorship of an elderly detective who took her under his wing. Purrlock quickly adapted her keen observational skills—honed from studying nature—to the complexities of urban life. She discovered that human behavior followed patterns just like the natural world. However, her methods were unsettling. Purrlock believed criminals didn't deserve mercy and insisted on punishing them outright. Her master disagreed, advocating that everyone deserves a second chance. Though he tried to temper her ruthlessness, her disdain for criminals only grew stronger. As her skills as a detective improved, her tolerance for wrongdoing diminished. Purrlock became obsessed with the idea of a crime-free city and pursued this ideal at any cost, eliminating anyone who stood in her way. Her relentless pursuit of justice turn her into a legend. She solves every case given to her, but the city's residents begin to question her methods. They admire her brilliance but fear her ruthlessness. Because of that, less and less people approach Purrlock Paws. They see her as dangerous, and only people in despair go out to look for her support. On this very day, a mother approaches Purrlock, asking her for help. Her daughter has gone missing, and no one knows where to find her. As always, Purrlock begins to investigate, and her findings point to members of the king's own family. When she tries to dig deeper, the king himself warns her to back off, or consequences would follow. But Purrlock refuses to stop. She is determined to find the truth, no matter the cost. True to his word, the king spreads lies about her, accusing Purrlock of being a murderer who uses her cases as an excuse to quench her thirst for violence. The city turns against her, and Purrlock is forced to flee. She returns to the forest, vowing never to rejoin the society that had betrayed her. However, Purrlock can't let go of her final case. With the help of companions she meets during her wandering, she learns about the identity of three individuals that have knowledge of what happened to the missing daughter. Yet Purrlock doesn't care to pursue them. Her hatred for society and its hypocrisy outweighs her desire for vengeance. She chooses to live in solitude, roaming Middle Earth and avoiding civilization. Still, she carries a quiet promise in her heart—if any of the three conspirators ever cross her path, she will not hesitate to attack them to get the information out of them…",

      "A former kitchen worker turned relentless pursuer of truth in Middle Earth",
    loreFulltext:
      "Scootles was born in the city as the only child of a hardworking fisherwoman. He never knew his father and began helping his mother from a young age. Quick to learn, Scootles mastered the art of fishing early on to support her. He loved the sea—the rivers, the fish, the smell of the water, the salty taste on his lips, and the wind in his hair. Life wasn't easy, but he found happiness in his simple routine. Waking up early to head to the sea never bothered Scootles. In fact, he enjoyed the peacefulness of the city at dawn, when only the workers are awake. After a morning on the water, he would help his mother sell their catch at the bustling marketplace. The market is the heart of the town, drawing people from all social classes. The wealthy are looking for the freshest goods, the middle class hunt for bargains, and the poor often come at the end of the day, hoping to claim leftovers. Scootles' mother has her own stall at the market, where she sells their morning catch. Though young and cheeky, Scootles quickly proved to be a natural salesman, charming customers with his wit and enthusiasm. As Scootles grew older, hard times fell upon the city. The economy declined, and fewer people could afford fresh fish. Feeling increasingly useless, Scootles watched as his mother, still strong and capable, managed the stall on her own. Jobs were scarce, but Scootles was determined to find work. He searched tirelessly but was turned away at every door. One day, his mother decided to take matters into her own hands. The royal family's food buyer had been a regular customer at her stall for years. When he arrived one morning, she asked if there might be a position for Scootles in the royal kitchen. The buyer, understanding the city's difficult circumstances and having watched Scootles grow up, agreed to arrange a job for him. Scootles was thrilled. Eager to prove himself, he quickly became an invaluable helper in the royal kitchen. Waking up early was second nature to him, thanks to his years at sea, and he tackled his duties with energy and dedication. As time passes, Scootles grows accustomed to life at the palace. Though his position is modest, he occasionally catches glimpses of the royal family—a rare privilege for someone of his humble background. He is proud of his work, which allows him to support his aging mother and afford a small apartment near the sea. Every morning, he wakes up early to enjoy the fresh breeze by the water, dreaming of saving enough money to buy his own house. The coming week is an especially busy one for Scootles. A royal birthday celebration—the grandest event of the year—requires days of preparation. By the end of it, Scootles is utterly exhausted. His friends invite him to join the festivities, but he declines, choosing instead to rest for the work ahead. Early the next morning, Scootles arrives at the palace to find the streets littered with remnants of the previous night's revelry. As he heads to the food chambers, he hears a scream. Alarmed, he runs towards the sound and finds the youngest prince standing by an open balcony door. Rushing over, Scootles asks what has happened. The prince, visibly shaken and still drunk, confesses that he has startled a maid on the balcony. In her fright, she has fallen over the railing into the river below. Panicked, the prince insists they leave the scene immediately, fearing anyone might notice. Though Scootles knows the situation is wrong, he is just a simple kitchen helper and doesn't dare to refuse. He leads the prince to a nearby tavern, nearly empty except for a lone drunkard. In a quiet corner, the prince recounts the incident in detail—how he had gone to grab a snack, noticed the maid where she wasn't supposed to be, and decided to scare her as a joke. Scootles urges the prince to confess to the king. Sobering up, the prince agrees, and the two return to the palace separately. Back in the kitchen, Scootles finds it impossible to focus. His thoughts are consumed by the missing maid. Surely the king will sound the alarm and send search parties any moment, he thinks. But the hours pass, and nothing happens. Scootles asks his coworkers about the maid, but they assume she has simply overindulged at the party and taken the day off. When Scootles returns home that night, he feels a deep unease. He realizes he knows the maid—she is someone he has seen often. Days pass, and the feeling doesn't fade. He is horrified to learn that the young prince has left the city to travel and continue his life elsewhere in Middle Earth without facing any consequences. Scootles can't let it go. He decides to track down the prince and demand answers. Why has no one searched for the maid? What truly happened that night? Gathering all the money he has saved over the years, Scootles sets off on a journey east, following rumors of the prince's whereabouts, determined to uncover the truth.",

    loreFulltext:
      "Sir Gullihop is the third son of the King of Middle Earth. From a young age, everything was handed to him on a silver platter. Yet, despite the luxuries surrounding him, he never received much attention from his father. As the third-born, he was not expected to inherit the throne—that is the destiny of his eldest brother, whom Sir Gullihop admires deeply. The eldest brother is everything he is not: Tall, strong, handsome, and charming. Meanwhile, his second brother is a prodigy, mastering advanced algebra at the age of four and graduating from university by twelve. Sir Gullihop, however, is neither strong nor brilliant. He is small, unremarkable in intelligence, and lacks his brothers striking presence. But what he lacks in talents, he makes up for with an endearing personality. His naive optimism and clumsy, good-natured behavior quickly made him beloved by the castles workers and townsfolk. While the king and his older sons focus on ruling the kingdom and preparing for their duties, Sir Gullihop is preoccupied with the pleasures of life. Lavish parties, the finest food from across Middle Earth, and the company of beautiful women occupy his days and nights. He is infamous for his reckless generosity, buying drinks for everyone at the citys many taverns and staying out long past the point of sensibility. Despite his frivolity, he is adored by the townspeople, who see him as a source of joy and lightheartedness. The king, however, grew increasingly frustrated with his youngest sons behavior. While he and his heirs were managing the kingdoms affairs, Sir Gullihop was gallivanting around, oblivious to the responsibilities of royalty. Determined to instill some sense of purpose in him, the king devised a plan: after his 21st birthday, Sir Gullihop would be sent on a journey to the farthest corners of Middle Earth. There, he would represent the crown, explore the wider world, and perhaps learn the value of duty. Sir Gullihops birthday parties are legendary, celebrated with a grandeur that rivals even the kings own festivities. For his 21st birthday, he pulls out all the stops. Guests from every corner of the kingdom pour into the city, the finest foods are prepared, and the greatest musicians of Middle Earth arrive to perform. The celebrations begin at dawn and last well into the night. The entire city is alive with music, dancing, feasting, and revelry. As the sun rises on the horizon, only a handful of hardy revelers remain, with Sir Gullihop at their center, still laughing and drinking. Exhausted but proud, he finally decides to call it a night. Tomorrow, he will leave the city to begin his journey, but he is confident that his grand celebration has left an impression on the kingdom. Hungry from the long night, Sir Gullihop wanders into the food chambers, gathering some bread, butter, and sausages before heading to the balcony for a quiet moment. As he gazes out at the mountains, rivers, and seas he would soon traverse, he noticed a maid sitting precariously on the balcony railing. This particular balcony is off-limits to the castle staff, but Sir Gullihop doesnt care much for his fathers strict rules. Still a bit drunk, he decides to play a prank. Sneaking up behind her, he shouts, What are you doing here on a balcony forbidden to ordinary maids! The maid, startled by his sudden outburst, loses her balance and tumbles over the railing into the river below. Horrified, Sir Gullihop screams for help. A kitchen worker, already up for the early morning duties, rushes to the scene. Trembling, Sir Gullihop explains what has happened. Desperate to escape the site of the tragedy, he begs the worker to accompany him to a nearby tavern, where he pours out his heart. The worker urges him to confess to the king and have search parties sent immediately to find the maid. Gathering his courage, Sir Gullihop runs to his fathers chambers to tell him everything. As hes about to knock on his fathers door, he hesitates. He is supposed to leave for his journey today, and the king might see reasons to change his plans because of this situation. After all, people disappearing after wild celebrations is hardly unusual. He returns to his chambers without telling the king of the incident. Sir Gullihop leaves the city a few hours later, convincing himself it wasnt his fault. He tells himself that the maid shouldnt have been there in the first place and that somebody will surely go ahead and look for her—though deep down, he knows the chances of survival are slim without immediate action. But life goes on. There are new people to meet, more friends to make, and countless adventures waiting for him. Sir Gullihop pushes the memory of that night to the back of his mind and sets out to enjoy the world, as he always had.",

      "Wanderleaf is getting old. He feels it with every step, the ache in his knees a constant reminder of the years he's left behind. Over the past century, he's traveled all across Middle Earth, climbing its mountain tops and crossing its deepest valleys. Wanderleaf has lived his life as a wanderer, meeting fascinating people from countless tribes. But the toll of his travels weighs not only on his body but also on his memory. At times, he forgets where he's going or what he's doing, that's why he always travels with companions now. His current companions are a group of young students on their way to the city to attend the birthday celebration of one of the princes. Wanderleaf knows that there are always state affairs being discussed at these events, but he no longer cares much about Middle Earth's politics, those days are long gone. Once, he had the honor of meeting the old king before his reign—the father of the current ruler. But since the old king's passing, Wanderleaf hasn't felt the need to engage with the royal family. His only concern is the preservation of peace, which allows him to wander freely. As they walk, Wanderleaf hears his companions excitedly discussing the upcoming celebration. The prince, it seems, has a reputation for hosting the best parties. For Wanderleaf, however, the journey to the city has a different purpose. He hopes to reunite with some old friends before continuing southward through Middle Earth. When the city appears on the horizon, the students gasp in awe, their excitement giving them a burst of energy to reach their destination by nightfall. Wanderleaf arrives in the city late at night. He bids farewell to his companions, who invite him for drinks, but he politely declines. The prince's birthday festivities the next day promise to be exhausting enough. He searches for a tavern to spend the night but struggles to decide—too much has changed since his last visit. Eventually, he takes a local's advice and chooses a tavern near the palace, one that offers a fine view of the surrounding lands. Despite the influx of tourists for the prince's birthday, the tavern still has a room available. Wanderleaf secures a second-floor room, carries his belongings upstairs, and, too tired to shower or eat, falls asleep the moment he sits down. The next morning, Wanderleaf wakes up feeling well-rested. After preparing for the day, he heads downstairs for breakfast. Outside, the city is already alive with celebration—people singing, dancing, and reveling in the streets. Letting himself be swept up in the festivities, Wanderleaf joins the crowd, partaking in various activities. The weariness of his travels melts away, and for a brief moment, he feels young again. The day ends with him enjoying a meal from a market stall while watching fireworks light up the night sky. He returns to his room at the tavern, his body aching but his heart full. That night, Wanderleaf is plagued by a nightmare. Years ago, while traveling through the northern forests of Middle Earth, something had startled him. It was in the middle of the night, when he was nearing a village as an unusual sound drew his attention to the nearby woods. Though visibility was poor, he caught sight of a pair of glowing, cat-like eyes fixed on him with a predatory hunger he had never seen before. Wanderleaf, usually unshakable, panicked and sprinted the remaining distance to the village. Ever since, those blue, glowing eyes have haunted his dreams. Waking up drenched in sweat, Wanderleaf takes a cold shower to get the fear out of his body and puts on fresh clothes. Feeling better, he heads downstairs for breakfast. The guest room is nearly empty, with only three others present: a drunkard recovering from the previous night's revelry and two people engaged in a heated discussion. Wanderleaf orders tea and retreats to a quiet corner with his book. Though he tries to focus on reading, the conversation between the two strangers catches his attention. He overhears something about a maid and the king but initially dismisses it, thinking it might be a scandalous affair. Such things happen, he muses. But as he listens more closely, he realizes he's misunderstood. The two are discussing how one of the king's maids was thrown off a balcony. As the two individuals leave, Wanderleaf catches a glimpse of one of their faces and is struck by recognition—it's the prince whose birthday was just celebrated! Intrigued, Wanderleaf tucks the encounter away in his mind. The following days pass as Wanderleaf reconnects with old friends, savoring the city's familiar yet changed rhythms. His stay is enjoyable, but one question lingers: Should he investigate further what he overheard in the tavern, or should he let it go? As Wanderleaf departs the city, continuing his journey south, he looks to the stars for guidance, wondering if they will show him the right path to take…",
